metric_evaluations.ncl is used for evaluation of the metrics with respect to the dynamically downscaled ERA5 (ERA5DD) for Figures 2,S2-S4
metric_evaluations_wrt_PRISM.ncl is used for evaluation of the metrics with respect to PRISM reference dataset for Figures S5-S8
metric_evaluations_GCMs.ncl is used for evaluation of dynamically downscaled GCMs for Figures 4, S12-S14
barplot.py is used to create bar plots for Figures 2, S9-S11
